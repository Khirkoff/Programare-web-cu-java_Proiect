I. Define the Business Requirements
Here are 10 business requirements we can use as a foundation:

Users (adopters) can register and log in to the system.
Shelters (staff) can register pets for adoption with details like breed, age, and health status.
Adopters can browse pets by type (dog, cat, etc.), age, and breed.
Adopters can submit adoption requests for pets.
Shelter staff can approve or decline adoption requests.
Each pet has a status (Available, Adopted, Pending).
Shelter staff can manage pet profiles (add, edit, delete).
Adopters can view the status of their adoption requests.
Users can make donations or pay adoption fees online.
The system maintains detailed records of adoptions.
II. Define the MVP Features
From the business requirements, we’ll implement the following 5 features for the MVP:

User Authentication:

Allow adopters and shelter staff to register and log in.
Role-based access: Adopters vs. Staff.
Pet Browsing:

Adopters can browse available pets by type, age, and breed.
Adoption Requests:

Adopters can submit requests for pets.
Staff can view and approve/decline requests.
Pet Management:

Shelter staff can add, update, or remove pet profiles.
Payment Integration:

Adopters can make payments for adoption fees or donations.
III. Database Design
We’ll need at least 6 entities with relationships. Example schema:

User:

Attributes: id, name, email, password, role (Adopter/Staff).
Relationship: One-to-Many with AdoptionRequest.
Pet:

Attributes: id, name, type, breed, age, status, health_status.
Relationship: One-to-Many with AdoptionRequest.
AdoptionRequest:

Attributes: id, pet_id, user_id, status (Pending/Approved/Declined), request_date.
Shelter (Optional for MVP):

Attributes: id, name, location, contact.
Donation:

Attributes: id, user_id, amount, date.
Payment:

Attributes: id, adoption_request_id, amount, payment_date.
IV. Development Plan
Set Up the Project:
Spring Boot application with dependencies for Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and validation.
REST Endpoints:
At least 5 endpoints, e.g.:
POST /users/register: Register a user.
GET /pets: List all pets.
POST /adoption/requests: Submit an adoption request.
PUT /adoption/requests/{id}: Approve/decline a request.
POST /donations: Make a donation.
Implement Services:
Business logic for user authentication, pet management, and adoption flow.
Database Integration:
Use an RDBMS like MySQL or H2 for persistence.
Testing:
Write unit tests for REST endpoints and services.
Document the API:
Use Swagger for documentation.
Demonstrate the Functionality:
Test with Postman.
